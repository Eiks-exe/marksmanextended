# Marksman Extended

Marksman Extended is a mod that aims to enhance Minecraft’s ranged‑combat experience by adding precision‑based mechanics, scalable damage bonuses, and satisfying combat feedback.

## Features

### Sharpshooter Enchantment
A new enchantment that increases **headshot damage per level**:

| Weapon Type | Headshot Multiplier            |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Bow         | +50% × level                   |
| Crossbow    | +50% × level                   |
| Muskets (from ewewukek's Musket Mod) | +35% × level |

Sharpshooter rewards accuracy and precision, making well‑placed shots significantly more impactful.

### Headshot Indicators
Marksman Extended provides clear feedback when you land a headshot:

- Visual indicator (can be toggled in the mod configuration)
- Audio indicator

These cues make ranged combat feel more responsive and satisfying.
